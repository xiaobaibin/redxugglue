The main purpose of this project is to make community available encoder and publisher for RTMP.<br />

A first step on making only java solution for RTMP streaming (not needing flash on anything).<br />
<br />
> -> RTMP file/webcam publisher (Done and working with FLV1 codec)<br />
> -> RTMP file/webcam H264 publisher (I would love Art's or Mondain's help on this)<br />
> -> RTMP streaming player (so easy using rtmpClient + xuggle for decoding)<br />
<br />

<br /><br />I am refactoring code, then I will commit.
<br />
Sponsors needed <br />
Just Java here.<br />
<br />
enjoy it.<br />
